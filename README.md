# Free drawn number recognition using Tensorflow library

#### *Mindaugas Vainauskas, 4th year Software Development course, Emerging Technologies Module, GMIT 2017*

## Description
 In this project I developed a prototype web application with simple interface that allows users to draw a number and then a Flask framework working with Tensorflow library in the backend returns a number that it thinks user drew.

## Technologies used
 - Flask Framework;
 - Python programming language;
 - Bootstrap and HTML front end;
 - Fabric.js library for Canvas drawing.
